# xbox-controller-game

Hello. Now this is just example of usage Controller API (tested on XBox One controller).

Here you can use left stick to handle dot movement, and right stick (Y axis) to handle dot size.

Soon I will add all triggers and buttons and write some simple games.

Will be very happy for collaboration.
